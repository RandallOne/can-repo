README 2017 V0.622

Project and intended tablet software still in progress. Software and instructions of use not yet avaiable. Software name also in progress. Based out of Victoria, BC Canada. Independant developers meeting every Wednesday at Universty of Victoria 

Goal: making software for an electronic e-reader to add music and clickable text to digital books, especially for [realistic fantasy books and fantasy books for adults](https://www.timothyrjeveland.com/) with a high vocabulary that requires readers to learn various Old and Middle English in order to understand the story. Our hope is that the fantasy genre can be used to teach students about the Middle Ages by encouraging them to expand their vocabulary via clicking on the Middle- Old English text. Also, lists of music that will autoplay when the reader reaches certian points of the book. For example when they change chapters the song will change; when they scroll past a fight scene the music will become more intense; when they scroll through beautiful description the music will become pleasent. Eventually we want the software to be able to change the music automatically rather than us having to preset it for each book. For instance when the reader comes across the words "blood", "sword" and "siege" in the same paragraph the music will automatically change.

Rails Version: Started in 2015. Currently using Rails 5.1 2017

Progress: We're about 20% done--now able to open rails on a Sony tablet thanks to Michael and his volunteer work in late 2016. Almost done software and getting ready to install it on the abovementioned tablet.

Expectations: We're hoping to be done by 2019 bu wouldn't be surprised if it takes us till 2022. We're expecting teachers in the future to hand all their course material out via digitally and wirelessly onto the student's tablets and phones and so we are working ahead of our time.

About our team: There are six of us who meet once a week and we are all passionate about the Middle Ages, history and realistic fantasy for adults. Our names are for now anonymous as we're requiring no credits and don't want to sully our previous projects by tainting our reputation, knowing that this project might fail and that our already reputable standing in Victoria's software developing community is in jeapordy. On the other hand if this project succeeds we will gladly announce our names.

Instructions: Noyt avaibale at this time as this project is still far from finsihed.

Thank you: For your pateince and interest, we are highly grateful!
